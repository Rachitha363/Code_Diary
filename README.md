# Daily Coding Problems

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Problems** repository! ðŸš€  
Here, I solve one programming problem each day and include solutions in **both Python and Java**.  
- Each file contains the **problem statement (commented)**.  
- The **Python solution** is written inside comments.  
- The **Java solution** is runnable code.  

This project helps me improve my problem-solving skills consistently.

## ðŸ“… Problems Solved

| Day | Problem | File |
|-----|----------|------|
| 1   | Reverse a String | [Day_01_Reverse_a_string.java] |
| 1   | Palindrome Check | [Day_02_Palindrome_Check.java] |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Run the **Java code** directly in VS Code or terminal.  
- Copy the Python part into a `.py` file if you want to test it separately.  
- New problems will be added **daily**.
